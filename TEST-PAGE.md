[//]: <!- **If you're seeing this secret message, that means it worked!** -->

Do you see a `**Peek**` button in the header? Try clicking it. If it works, this page will open up in your local editing environment.

To use `git-peek`, with private repositories, [configure your environment](https://github.com/Jarred-Sumner/git-peek#private-repositories--choosing-an-editor)

If you want to configure git-peek, head over to the main [git-peek repo](https://github.com/Jarred-Sumner/git-peek).
