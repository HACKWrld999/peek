Instantly open files, pull requests, and repositories from GitHub in your local editor. Read, search, and review code from the comfort of your own local editing environment.

git-peek stores the files in a temporary directory, and automatically deletes the repository from your computer when you close your editor. [git-peek](https://github.com/Jarred-Sumner/git-peek) is also available as a CLI, this is the browser extension.

This adds "Peek" buttons to Github that open `git-peek://github-url-in-here`, which triggers `git-peek` to very quickly fetch the file/branch/repo/pull request and open it in your local editor. All the magic is in `git-peek`. This just adds some buttons so you don't have to paste links into your terminal.
